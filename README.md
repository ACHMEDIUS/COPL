# λ-calculus parser, interpreter and type checker
# <h3>1. λ-calculus parser</h3>
# The standard format used for the λ-calculus is the following:
# variables are represented by their names.
# Lambda abstractions are represented by the keyword λ, followed by the variable name, followed by a dot, followed by the body of the abstraction.
# Applications are represented by the function name followed by a space, followed by the argument.
# For example, the expression (λx. x + 1) 3 would be represented as λx. x + 1 3 in the standard format.
# <h3>2. λ-calculus interpreter</h3>
# For this assignment, the lambda character is represented by "λ".
# <h3>3. λ-calculus type checker</h3>
